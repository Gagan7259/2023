   <h1>Product description</h1>
    <p id="one">The PNY CS900 2.5-inch SATA-III (6 Gb/s) solid state drive (SSD) is an excellent choice for a mainstream solid
        state drive (SSD) upgrade from a hard disk drive (HDD). The CS900 drive is designed for an easy and
        cost-effective HDD replacement in the existing PC system to help realize faster boot times, quicker application
        launches, and better overall system performance. With no moving parts, PNY CS900 is highly durable, less likely
        to fail.

    <h1>User Review</h1>
    <p id="two">I own an HP EliteBook 2760p with a 2nd Gen i7 processor with Windows 10 installed. From hitting the power button
        to *actually being usable* the laptop would take almost 4 minutes. Running programs would be slow as well. Once
        running the laptop would be fine just slow to respond.

        Enter the PNY 480GB SSD drive. I installed it easily. It was literally just 5 case screws and 4 drive tray
        screws then a drive swap. I put it all back together and then used the Windows 10 install tool via USB to format
        the drive and install Windows. Once all the updates available from Microsoft were completely installed and all
        device drivers were set I shut the laptop down. So here we go... From hitting the power button to *actually
        being usable* the laptop now takes 35 seconds. Programs are snappy and responsive.</p>
